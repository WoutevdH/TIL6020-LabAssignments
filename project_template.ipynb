    "__Introduction__\n",
    "\n",
    "The global trend of urbanization is rapidly accelerating, the United Nations projects that by 2050, 68% of the world’s population will live in urban areas, roughly 20% more than the 55% in 2018. This shift has significant implications for transportation networks, as urban and rural populations exhibit different travel behaviors. Understanding these differences is key to planning future investments in road and public transport infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the modal split is expected to vary between urban and rural areas. Cities are anticipated to favor public transport, while rural areas are likely to rely more on private vehicles. Age could play a role, with different age groups expected to exhibit distinct travel patterns. By analyzing modal split across urban, rural, and age factors, this research aims to provide insights that could benefit infrastructure development and capacity planning.\n",

    "The research objective for this project is the following:\n",

    "- How is the distribution of the modal split affected in urban vs. rural areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question first some sub questions are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In what way is the modal split affected by age? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Per age group, what differences can be observed between urban and rural areas?"

It also provides details about the traveler’s origin, including the province, region, age and whether they come from a rural or urban area. The level of urbanization is categorized into five levels, ranging from \"Niet stedelijk\" (non-urban) to \"Zeer stedelijk\" (highly urbanized).\n"

    "To streamline the data for analysis and visualization, several selections have been made. The traveler’s origin will be categorized based only on the level of urbanization, disregarding geographical location. Age data will be preserved to answer a sub-research question. Modal split will be analyzed on a yearly basis, reducing the dataset to a more manageable size. No trends over time will be examined in this research. Therefore, data from 2018, 2019, and 2023 will be averaged, excluding discrepancies caused by the COVID-19 period. This is done to ensure a consistent and robust dataset."
